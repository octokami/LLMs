It goes without saying that the images are awesome - Canon got that right years ago and continues to make improvements - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they made all the right changes to make me love this camera even more than the S400.

The player is VERY light weight and straight forward to use.  I also realy like the capability to upgrade it later on by adding an SD card - nice!

1489;"I've had mine for about two weeks now. Overall it's a great little player. It could be better, but definitly worth having. This item is recommended. Even when better ones come out later, it will be a great MP3 player to pass on to someone else.  I plan on buying another as a gift for a friend.

Comes with good headphones, but I have a really nice wide spectrum Sony set. Makes a difference in the lows and highs.

PROS:
- The sound quality is excellent - same as iPod as far as I can tell.

1) Plug the camera into the electrical socket

2) Make the camera switch set to ""play video""

3) Choose the ""printer/PC"" option on the camera's screen

4) Launch iMovie, it recognizes the camera!

Indeed, the poster riled by the THD number is giving you a 1% distortion rate but this is only for the most sensitive frequency 1kHz. Overall from 20-20000kHz there is a stat of .09% THD just like most of the specs claim. No confusion anymore, I am looking at my book.

For Video: My Blu-ray player through HDMI connector goes directly to the HDMI in on TV. My FIOS HD DVR box via HDMI goes directly into the TV.

For Audio: Blu-ray to new receiver via optical; FIOS HD DVR to new receiver via optical.

I have all video going directly to TV and all audio to receiver.

3576;Finally a digital camcorder that won't break your bank but is not skimping on the features. I tried other digital camcorders in the past, from the cheaper $100 range, and they all have two major flaws: lack of image stability control and poor performance in low light. This one overcomes both and I'm very happy with it. It also takes decent pictures, although it doesn't match current cameras resolution.;switch;Sentiment.negative

1) Plug the camera into the electrical socket

2) Make the camera switch set to ""play video""

3) Choose the ""printer/PC"" option on the camera's screen

4) Launch iMovie, it recognizes the camera!

It was just easier to take good pictures indoors, which is where I do most of my shooting.  The Canon took more effort to produce good pictures.  Plus I liked the interface of the Olympus more.

3962;"First, it is my opinion that the Olympus e520 is absolutely the best DSLR camera you will find in its price class. Sure, there are more expensive models from other brands that are better. But for the money, you will not find a more capable camera.

Also, it is my opinion that there are three components that determine the quality of a photograph.
1) the camera. 2) the lens, and 3) the photographer's ability to use the camera properly.

So keep those things in mind when deciding which camera to buy, you need a good lens t";prices;Sentiment.positive

The price was great for such a feature packed product, and I really liked the layout of all the information. Olympus gives you 3 ways to access all the essentials (ISO, White Balance, Auto/Manual Focus mode, etc) and much more (Saturation, Sharpness, Face Detection, etc.)

I've had this camera now for about 6 months...long enough for me to evaluate it some more.  It's about 75% + and about 25% minus.  I find it easy to use.  Some reviewers did not.  At first, it didn't look very sharp on my computer monitor.  And the LCD screen doesn't let you zoom in on preview with much sharpness.  So, until I actually had some photos printed off the card, I wasn't convinced.  It does produce sharp, saturated photos.

It's very easy to start using this camera. This is my third digital camera and with my previous two cameras, I never could figure out how to use the recording feature to make videos. I gave my first camera away without ever figuring it out. With this one, I was recording on my very first day sans manual.

Like many, I upgraded from a point and shoot to the world of micro-four thirds.  My first few lenses were primes and the standard zooms.  The Olympus was my first foray into the world of wide angle.

With a range of 9-18mm, it has a standard view of 18mm to 36mm which is a very nice wide range.  While the competing Panasonic goes from ";amount;Sentiment.negative

Small and light, useful range.
Surprisingly excellent color rendition on Lumix G1 (haven't tried Panny 7-14 or Oly cameras though, can't compare). On a bright day sky is always deep blue, almost as if I had a polarizer on it. Same with bright shiny objects.

Cons:
Annoying Lock Button, always in the way. Definite over-engineering.
Prone to flare in direct sun (less than a copy of 45mm f1.8 that I've tried, though) but what wide angle lens doesn't.

5984;Extremely compact lens, though approximately doubles in length in use.  Produces nice photos. (I use it with an Olympus OM-D and a Panasonic GF2.)  This lens provides a new perspective for landscape photography, which I could not get previously.  (Stitched together photos.)  I could easily see this as a good walking around lens and complements my other micro 4/3 lenses 20mm f1.7, 14mm f2.5, and 14-45mm f3.5.  It is relatively an expensive lens.;design;Sentiment.positive

When it comes to playing any fast paced online game, the difference in winning and losing is often split seconds.  This TV gives you a big advantage because the input lag is so low.  I haven't measured the lag yet, but it is visibly faster than the TV it is replacing.  THE IPS Alpha display used on this set is excellent for game play.

10653;If one has to work within a budget this Pioneer Elite SC-65 is the best Receiver available for total home theater results. There have been many great reviews and I have nothing negative to say at all. Our 8 speakers have never had it so good nor have our ears and our new Samsung 7100 TV improved as soon as it was fed it's input via this receiver's HDMI out vs the HDMI from our Dish box which was very good in it's own right and now feeds the receiver.;issue;Sentiment.negative

10656;I love Pioneer receivers. I had a low end Pioneer Elite before that developed a problem that was going to cost too much to fix, so I replaced it with a medium priced Denon.

After much adjusting and advice, I gave up, and ordered this upper range priced Pioneer and I'm glad I did.

I have used the GH2 for years as a filmmaker and was excited for the new features of the G6, hoping to replace my GH2.
The G6 performs excellently and to my eyes looks identical to the GH2's quality, not bad for the price.
A big perk of the G6 is 1080p at 60fps, not to mention 60p while using ExTele (GH3 is only 30p).

Focus is fast as are startup and there is very little shutter lag. The stop action animation function is a hoot. High ISO quality is very good.

EVERYTHING is configurable on it, so you can customize it to your method of shooting.

Favorite things:
I love the fact that you can adjust the exposure with the rocker near the shutter button - probably my favorite feature. You can see instantly the exposure, adjust it and shoot. Great for backlit scenes etc.
The autofocus is quick. I like the Q-menu.

The G6 is 25% better in all aspects over the G3 and G5.  Faster, better image quality, easier handling and responsive along with many new added features including panorama mode.  What I like is that the G6 under exposes the pictures where as the G3-G5 over exposed and burned out the highlights.  Not so with the G6.

Also, the camera freezes out of the blue, I have to take out the battery out and put it back. Probably with the latest firmware that could be resolved. Otherwise it is an amazing camera, it is a truly DSLR replacement for me.

Pros:
One of the best APS-C cameras reviewed yet
Captures 4K videos directly to media card
Fast response, speedy focusing

Cons:
Limited number of S-series lenses
Doesnt have DSLR stamina (for burst modes)
Heavier than other mirrorless models

25060;"Trying to convince your wife to let you buy a $650 lens when you already own the Oly 45mm, Panasonic 14mm, and Panasonic 20mm is no simple task. But as luck would have it (and 2.5 glasses of wine), she agreed and I made the purchase before she realized what she had agreed to.

No regrets though. This is a great lens. Super fast and quiet AF, fantastic IQ, and very impressive build quality. While it's not quite the ""pancake"" size as the Panasonic 14mm and 20mm, it doesn't bother me as the quality and speed of it makes it";speakers;Sentiment.positive
26061;The NX1 is my personal favorite camera for portrait photography and 4K video production. Increasing the video bitrate only makes the detail better and reduces moire. I have the 10 f3.5 fisheye, 30 f2.0, 45 f1.8, 12 f2.0 (Rokinon manual), 16-50S f2.0-2.8, 50-150S f2.8 and 50-200 III. I also have the Samsung pro flash, various adapters and Nikkor/Tokina 35mm manual lenses. The NX1 still competes well in 2017 even though it was released in 2014.

26065;Very nice camera. Gently used and well cared for from what I can tell so far. I have a lot to learn about all of the features and there are many! The touch screen is amazing. I forget I can navigate that way sometimes. I debated on the purchase, but found I couldn't get the same deal on the new one with this lens. The lens is HEAVY and makes the camera as heavy as my Canon DSLR with a similar lens.  Four starts because I think they should have used the same viewfinder and rotating screen from the NX30.
