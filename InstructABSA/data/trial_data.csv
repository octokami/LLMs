Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday. If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer. Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening. The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.,"[{'term': 'view', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'service', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'food', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'food', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'lava cake dessert', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
Pizza here is consistently good. Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal. You should pass on the calamari. It is thick and slightly soggy. Decor is charming. Service is average.,"[{'term': 'Pizza', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'Salads', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'calamari', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'NULL', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'Decor', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'Service', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"

"I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two. For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan. MMmmm... it was delicious. Service was slow, but the people were friendly. It's a nice place to relax and have conversation. I can't wait to go back.","[{'term': 'Bombay beer', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'NULL', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'Service', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'people', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'place', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'NULL', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
"I went here with a friend on a whim, we went someplace else first and couldn't get a table. Service here was great, food was fantastic. Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared. Will absolutely visit again. Maybe tomorrow ;-)","[{'term': 'Service', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'food', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'Guacamole+shrimp appetizer', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'filet', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'frites', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'NULL', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
"Molto bene! This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list. The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment. Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite. Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate. A guaranteeed delight!","[{'term': 'trattoria', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'trattoria', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'food', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'dishes', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'specials', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'regular menu-fare', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'parmesean porcini souffle', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'candle-light', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'food', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'service', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'term': 'tables', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'NULL', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"

"I was very disappointed with this restaurant. Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away. I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested. Food was okay, nothing great. Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family.  I/we will never go back to this place again.","[{'term': 'restaurant', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'cart attendant', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'NULL', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'Food', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'term': 'Chow fun', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'pork shu mai', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'NULL', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'term': 'place', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
"Excellent food, although the interior could use some help. The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting, without it trying to be that.

Way below average I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked. Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive.
